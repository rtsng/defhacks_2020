<h2>Reviews</h2>
<h3
  <div style="width:100%; height:100; overflow-y:scroll">
    Grace: I absolutely loved this place! We decided to come here 
    on a whim and my family definitely enjoyed their time here. 
    The children had fun swimming while the rest of us 
    relaxed on the beach. Will definitely be coming back next year!
    
    John: I really miss living in High Park. My second year of 
    living in this city, I lived in a condo that overlooked the 
    entire park facing south and every morning I would wake up 
    to the sight of green (white if it was winter) and the blue 
    horizon of the lake. High Park is the best park in Toronto 
    to spend a whole day in. Take your kids, take your dog, take
    your mom. There are many kms of trails that zig zag your way 
    through the park and you might even come on to some hidden 
    gems that you didn't know about. Like the mini zoo (though 
    now closed due to the pandemic) known for its notorious escaping 
    jailbirds (hah- pun intended) like the screaming peacock screaming
    its lungs out as it roamed the neighborhood for weeks before the
    authorities caught up with him. Or the pair of Capybaras that 
    made the lake inside the park their vacation resort. The park 
    is also the best place to catch Cherry Blossoms every year in 
    spring, however I doubt you'll see many this year due to the 
    social distancing restrictions. Plan to spend the day there, 
    just take a picnic basket, some blankets, some wine and water 
    and you will not regret getting lost in all the green and forget 
    that you are dead centre of a bustling city.
    PS. It's a great place to take engagement pictures as well!
    
    Steven: Well, this is my hood. Definitely my number one park in 
    Toronto. Ideal for walking and for hanging out with friends and 
    family. High Park is home for many festivals and activities during
    the year. If you are visiting the park on the weekends during spring
    and summer months it is not easy to find a parking spot. You can enter 
    the park from a few sides but the main entrance is from Bloor Street 
    West. There is also Zoo inside the park with free admission.
    The Grenadier Cafe is located in the heart of the park so if you 
    wanna coffee or some food this place is good for it. It is very 
    expensive but they have a cool location inside the park with a 
    nice patio area in front. If you like fishing there are some cool 
    spots for that. Cherry blossom is one of my favorite festivals in 
    High Park. Keep in mind if you are planning to visit this festival 
    it is very crowded and it is impossible to find the parking.
    
    Calvin: 
    I had a 5 hour layover. I wanted to go out and see something in 
    Toronto. I had to clear American AND Canadian customs at that time, 
    I wanted at least 3 hours for that. So what did I do? I called an Uber 
    and went to High Park. It's so beautiful! It's huge! The squirrels there 
    are black (seriously!!!). I wish I could've seen more of Toronto, but this
    park, with its lakes, it's hills, it's gardens...was just delightful.
