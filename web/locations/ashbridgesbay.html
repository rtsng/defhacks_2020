  <div class="bottom-center">Ashbridges Bay Park is located in a beautiful area on the waterfront in the east end of Toronto. Ashbridges Bay was once part of the large sand dune chain spanning the majority of the Toronto Harbour. These dunes were the result of sediment from the Scarborough Bluffs being deposited by the currents from Lake Ontario.</div>
